Xbox Live Friends
=======

Xbox Live Friends is a tool for keeping a vigilant eye on what all of your friends are doing. Are they killing someone in Gears of War? Are they experiencing the sights and sounds of Liberty City in GTA IV? And most importantly, how many points do they have?

Making Improvements
------------

Xbox Live Friends is a sort of pet project, built on-and-off over several years. The quality of the source code cannot be guaranteed. It is my hope that The People will be able to assist me in taking over the project, and making this the best Xbox Live application for the Mac that is possible.
